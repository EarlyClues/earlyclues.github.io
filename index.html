<p><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Google Inc. Ventures to Acquire Early Clues, LLC</b></p>

<p>TRI-CITIES – JANUARY 05, 2015 — Early Clues, LLC (UFP: EARC) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to sell its total assets to Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) for an undisclosed amount.</p> 
 
<p>Early Clues' mission is to reimagine interactions between end users and APIs. Since its launch in 2013, the Early Clues Garuda Application Suite has been a consistent best seller--and the recently launched Lawn Computing Dashboard has received rave reviews.</p>
 
<p>Larry Page, CEO of Google, said: “Early Clues has built a tremendous team that we are excited to welcome into the Google family. They’re already delivering amazing products you can try right now--automated lawn computers you can use to enhance your landscape and a coding language that anybody can learn in an afternoon. We are excited to bring the Early CLues experience to more homes in more countries and fulfill their dreams!”</p>
 
<p>Roger Holliday, IAO of Early CLues, said: “We’re thrilled to join Google. With their support, Early Clues will be even better placed to provide a wide range of reality enhancement modalities across an even more robust cultural spectrum.”</p>
 
<p>Early Clues will continue to operate under the leadership of its current Board and with its own distinct brand identity, subject to provisional branding oversight and customer support from the Google team. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals in the US. It is expected to close in the next few months.</p>
